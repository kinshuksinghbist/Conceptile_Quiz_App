## üìã Tech Stack

- **Backend**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)  
- **Templating**: [Jinja Templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) (built into Django)  
- **Frontend**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
- **Database**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)  

---

## üí° Why This Tech Stack?

The choice for tailwindcss and sqlite db was made becuase they are fast and flexible. A SQLite DB doesnt require a server setup and tailwindcss is pug and play.

## üõ† Improvements Possible

1. **New User Generation**:  
   - While there is one superuser configured right now, enabling sign up funcitonality would be a big plus

2. **Changing the DB engine to something like POSTGRESQL for more robust scaling**:  
  
3. **Django could be configured with NextJS for more flexbility and better UI**:

## üéâ Conclusion

This **Quiz App** demonstrates a clean architecture with Django as the backend, Jinja templates for rendering, and Tailwind CSS for modern UI styling. SQLite ensures simplicity and ease of use during development.
